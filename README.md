# PWAs
 **Progressive Web Apps**

 Creating a mobile web application without Android or IOS development.

## There are three key components of a PWA:
1. **Service Worker:** The service worker transforms the website into an app by allowing it to download and cache files on a device.
2. **Web Manifest:** This JSON file provides the basic meta-information about the app, such as the app icon, background color, etc.
3. **Secure HTTPS:** HTTPS is mandatory and makes PWAs more secure than regular web apps.

## PWAs have pros and cons. Among the former:
- **Cheap and Fast Development:** PWAs are less expensive, quicker, and easier to create than native apps. Native app development from the ground up necessitates particular technologies for both platforms. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all that are required for a PWA.
- **Cross-Platform Availability:** One of the promising advantages of PWAs is that they can be installed and run on multiple devices across various operating systems.
- **Offline Functionality:** Having bad or no internet at all won’t stop users from using your app as it can cache data for offline viewing using service workers.
- **Performance:** Compared to native mobile apps, PWAs are much lighter, don’t take as much memory space, and have a faster load time.

## On the negative side:
- **High Battery Usage:** Because PWAs are built-in high-level web code, phones have to work harder to read the code; they use more battery than native apps.
- **Mobile hardware access:** PWAs cannot access various hardware features like the device’s Bluetooth, proximity sensors, etc.
- **Distribution:** Since PWAs are not distributed through the app store, you may miss out on users who mainly browse the app store.

## You should consider using/building Progressive Web Apps if you meet the following criteria:
- You don’t have the budget to build a full-fledged app.
- You need to push to your target audience faster.
- Having cross-platform compatibility is essential to your business.
